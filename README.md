# perl-guncon2
Some proof-of-concept work I did to use the GunCon2 USB lightgun as a mouse, first on FreeBSD, then cross-platform as a libusb-driven device.  This work is unfinished, 
but may prove helpful to others as documentation.  Written in 2008, does not use bitwise operators, doesn't use proper conventions in several places, and certainly isn't 
object-oriented.  It was just my first forray into hardware hacking.  Here for historical purposes.
